# About This Johnny Decimal System

## What is Johnny Decimal?

The Johnny Decimal system is a methodology for organizing information using a numerical system. It was created by Johnny Noble as a way to bring order to digital and physical files.

## My Implementation

This implementation follows the core Johnny Decimal principles:

- Information is divided into 10 broad areas (00-99)
- Each area contains up to 10 categories (e.g., 11-19)
- Individual items within categories receive decimal identifiers (e.g., 11.01)

## Areas Overview

- **00-09 - Meta**: Information about this organizational system
- **10-19 - Personal**: Personal information and life administration
- **20-29 - Work**: Professional projects, development, and workplace items
- **30-39 - Digital Side Projects**: Personal coding and development projects
- **40-49 - Learning & Development**: Educational materials and skills development
- **50-59 - Media & Entertainment**: Creative works and entertainment collections
- **60-69 - Health & Wellbeing**: Health tracking and wellness information
- **70-79 - Social & Community**: Relationship and community management
- **80-89 - Archive**: Archived materials from other categories
- **90-99 - Miscellaneous**: Items that don't fit elsewhere

## Benefits of This System

- **Easy retrieval**: The numerical system makes finding information intuitive
- **Prevents duplication**: Clear categories reduce duplicate storage
- **Scalable**: The system can grow with my needs while maintaining organization
- **Technology-agnostic**: Works across digital and physical files
- **Reduces decision fatigue**: Predefined categories streamline file management

## System Maintenance

This system is reviewed quarterly to ensure it continues to meet my organizational needs. Categories may be adjusted, added, or archived as my workflows evolve.
