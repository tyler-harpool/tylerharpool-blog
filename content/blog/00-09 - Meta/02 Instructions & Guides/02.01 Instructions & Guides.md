# Johnny Decimal System Guide

## Getting Started

This guide will help you navigate and maintain our Johnny Decimal system in Obsidian.

### Basic Principles

1. **Areas (10-19, 20-29, etc.)**: Broad divisions for major aspects of life and work
2. **Categories (11, 12, 21, etc.)**: Specific topics within each area
3. **IDs (11.01, 21.03, etc.)**: Individual items with decimal identifiers

### Naming Conventions

- **Area folders**: `10-19 - Personal`
- **Category folders**: `11 Me`
- **Item files**: `11.01 Personal Information.md`
- **Reference format**: Use ID numbers when referring to items in notes, e.g., "See 11.01 for details"

## Adding New Content

### Creating a New Item

1. Identify the appropriate category
2. Check the highest existing ID number in that category
3. Create a new file with the next sequential decimal number
4. Begin the filename with that decimal ID
5. Use the included templates when appropriate

Example:
```
21.01 Project Overview.md
21.02 Project Timeline.md
21.03 Project Resources.md (new file)
```

### Creating a New Category

If no existing category fits your content:

1. Identify the appropriate area
2. Choose an unused category number within that area
3. Create the category folder with descriptive name
4. Add your item files within the new category

## Using in Obsidian

### Linking Between Files

Use the standard Obsidian linking syntax with Johnny Decimal IDs:

```
See [[21.01 Project Overview]] for more details.
```

### Tags

Use tags to create cross-references that span categories:
- `#active` for current projects
- `#priority` for high-priority items
- `#reference` for reference materials
- Custom tags for specific projects: `#betting-app`, `#health-goal`

### Daily Integration

1. Create a daily note in your preferred format
2. Reference Johnny Decimal IDs when documenting work on specific items
3. Use the checkin template for structured daily reviews

## Maintenance

### Quarterly Review

1. Review all active categories
2. Archive completed projects (move to 80-89 area)
3. Evaluate if new categories are needed
4. Check for duplicate information
5. Update this guide as the system evolves

### Troubleshooting

- **Unsure where to file something?** Use 92 Unsorted temporarily
- **Multiple potential categories?** Choose the most relevant and cross-reference with links
- **Need to move a file?** Update all internal links after moving

## Advanced Usage

### Dataview Integration

Use Dataview queries to create dynamic lists based on Johnny Decimal categories:

```
TABLE file.ctime as "Created"
FROM #active AND [[20-29 - Work]]
SORT file.ctime DESC
```

### Templates

See the Templates folder (03) for standardized formats for:
- Project notes
- Meeting notes
- Daily check-ins
- Weekly reviews
