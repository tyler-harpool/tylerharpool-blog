# Standards for technological innovation 

Wendell Berry’s 1987 essay ["Why I Am not Going To
Buy A Computer"](https://classes.matthewjbrown.net/teaching-files/philtech/berry-computer.pdf)  remains strikingly relevant today. Though written in a very different technological era, his reflections on innovation, responsibility, and the purpose of tools still resonate powerfully—perhaps even more so in our digitally saturated world.

What makes Berry’s argument compelling is that it isn't rooted in nostalgia or anti-technology sentiment, but in a thoughtful critique of how we choose to integrate new tools into our lives. He outlines a set of ethical and practical standards—focused on sustainability, human dignity, affordability, and community impact—that challenge us to ask whether a given technology genuinely enhances our lives or merely adds complexity and detachment.

As someone deeply invested in technology—particularly in building systems that are intelligent, responsive, and designed to serve real human needs—I found Berry’s principles both humbling and grounding. His essay prompted me to reconsider how I define progress. In my own work, I often focus on efficiency, scalability, and performance. But Berry reminds me that the most meaningful innovations are those that align with human values, strengthen relationships, and preserve the integrity of our shared world.
 

1. The new tool should be cheaper than the one
it replaces.

2. It should be at least as small in scale as the one it replaces.

3. It should do work that is clearly and demonstrably better than the one it replaces.

4. It should use less energy than the one it replaces.
5. If possible, it should use some form of solar energy, such as that of the body.

6. It should be repairable by a person of ordinary intelligence, provided that he or she has the necessary tools.

7. It should be purchasable and repairable as near to home as possible.
8. It should come from a small, privately owned shop or store that will take it back for maintenance and repair.
9. It should not replace or disrupt anything good that already exists, and this includes family and community relationships.
