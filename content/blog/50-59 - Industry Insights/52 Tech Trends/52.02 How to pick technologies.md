# Standards for technological innovation

  Wendell Berry wrote a serious article titled, "Why I Am not Going To
Buy A Computer" its still relevant even if it was written in 1987. Its remarkable in its accuracy on describing true technological innovation. As somebody who loves technology and wants to see it advancement in the best way possibe these rules resignated with me. 


1. The new tool should be cheaper than the one
it replaces.

2. It should be at least as small in scale as the one it replaces.

3. It should do work that is clearly and demonstrably better than the one it replaces.

4. It should use less energy than the one it replaces.
5. If possible, it should use some form of solar energy, such as that of the body.

6. It should be repairable by a person of ordinary intelligence, provided that he or she has the necessary tools.

7. It should be purchasable and repairable as near to home as possible.
8. It should come from a small, privately owned shop or store that will take it back for maintenance and repair.
9. It should not replace or disrupt anything good that already exists, and this includes family and community relationships.
