# AI

How technology policy is shaped and enforced

he current AI debate has split into two unrealistic camps, both missing the mark entirely. On one side, you have people convinced we need to tear down our entire technological infrastructure before AI can be safely useful. On the other, there are those predicting inevitable AI domination and human obsolescence. Both positions ignore a fundamental reality: we're not passive spectators in this game.

Think of it like coaching a powerful new player joining your team. You don't bench your entire roster out of fear, nor do you assume the newcomer will automatically take over as captain. Instead, you integrate their strengths while maintaining team structure and leadership. That's exactly our relationship with AI technology.

The path forward isn't about choosing between technological apocalypse or utopian surrender. We're developing AI systems that will enhance human capabilities without requiring us to abandon the institutions, systems, and safeguards we've built over centuries. Like any powerful tool—from the printing press to the internet—AI will transform how we work and live, but within frameworks we establish and maintain.

The reality is both simpler and more reassuring than either extreme suggests: we remain in the driver's seat. We set the rules, define the boundaries, and determine how this technology serves human goals. It's unfortunate that such a basic principle of technological governance needs stating, but here we are, needing to remind ourselves of something that should be obvious.

We will have AI. It will not destroy us. And we don't need to destroy everything else to make it work.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
