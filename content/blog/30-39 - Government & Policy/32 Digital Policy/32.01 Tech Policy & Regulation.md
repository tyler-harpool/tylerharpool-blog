How technology policy is shaped and enforced

I think we live in a weird world where proponents of ai think we need to burn it all down before AI will be useful. 
i think its nonsensecial to believe on the other that AI will take over. Both of these extremes are beyond reason. We will have AI it wil not destroy us, and we don't have to destroy the world. Its hard to believe somebody had to write this. But this is where we are. We aee I remind you in control of technology.
